Project Goals

In this project, I wrote JavaScript functions to power a small human v computer guessing game. My code ran in the browser instead of just the terminal.

In this project, I wrote four functions in script.js. Codecademy provided some additional JavaScript code in game.js that called my functions based on user interactions
