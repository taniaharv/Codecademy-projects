Project Details

In this project, I built a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on my own computer. 

At a high-level, this project required the following:

    A folder structure that made sense for the project
    An HTML file
    A CSS file

To successfully complete the project, I needed to use 4 provided images.

The rest of the pageâ€™s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) was outlined in the following design spec.
